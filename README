This MOD allows moderators on a phpBB-powered forum to perform multiple
moderation actions in fewer clicks. This allows moderation to occur
more efficiently and can be a big help on larger board.

Implemented moderation actions include:
	locking a topic
	moving a topic
	copying a topic
	replying to a topic
	stickying a topic
	adding a topic prefix (new feature not present in phpBB by default)

Planned actions include:
	unlock
    unstick
    remove prefix
    announce/unannounce (global or local)
    
Topic prefixes may also be implemented separately from multi-mods.
